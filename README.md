# pim-solutions
My solutions to some of the exercises in [A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics](https://pimbook.org).

This is not indended to be a comprehensive list, but simply putting up my solutions to (hopefully eventually) all of the "prove" and some of the programming exercises. I am also intending to do all of the "inline" "exercises to the reader" which are not part of the actual exercises section in each chapter.
